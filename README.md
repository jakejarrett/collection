# Collection
* **Tiny** Unminified filesize is ~520 bytes
* **Extensible** Its a small class that you can easily extend with ES6
* **Easy to use** Simply call add / remove for your models
* **Agnostic** Simply works with objects, doesn't have any dependency for any function from each model (You could mix & match models if you needed)

## Notice
Be aware, this project is only written for ES6+ clients at the moment.

For a list of supported browsers, check the [mdn browser compatability list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Browser_compatibility) for ES6 classes
